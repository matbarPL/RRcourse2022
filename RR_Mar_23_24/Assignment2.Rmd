# Breaking Bad - the first season. Insights on the viewership.

## Brief description of the show

As [@list_bb_wiki] stated, _Breaking Bad_ is an American television drama series created by Vince Gilligan, which premiered in 2008 on the cable network AMC. The story is about Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After White is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he uses his chemistry expertise to cook crystal meth, assisted by his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to secure his family's (played by Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte) inheritance before he dies.

During the course of the series, 62 episodes of Breaking Bad aired over five seasons. The pilot episode was first aired on January 20, 2008, and the series finale, was broadcast on September 29, 2013. Breaking Bad: Original Minisodes, which consisted several one- to five-minute clips, released 17 short episodes over the course of three years throughout Breaking Bad's run [@1].

On October 11, 2019, Netflix released El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, a feature film continuation of Breaking Bad, written and directed by Gilligan [@2]. An additional short film Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short was released on February 17, 2020 [@3].

## Loading data and presenting basic statistics

```{r}
load("../Data/bb_season_1.RData")
summary(bb_season_data$us_viewers)
```

Summary of some basic statistics on viewership in USA revealed that this distribution is positively skewed.

## Visualization

### Viewership over time

```{r}
bb_season_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = original_air_date, y = us_viewers)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Airing date",
       y = "U.S. Viewers (millions)",
       title = "Line chart showing the viewership data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}
change_in_viewership <- bb_season_data %>%
  mutate(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership = round(100*(us_viewers - lag(us_viewers))/lag(us_viewers)),
         episode_to_episode = paste0(as.character(no_season), "-", as.character(lag(no_season)))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership))
max_decrease <- change_in_viewership %>% pull(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership) %>% min()
min_change <- change_in_viewership %>%
  mutate(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership = abs(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership)) %>% pull(episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership) %>%
  min()
change_in_viewership %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = episode_to_episode, y = episode_to_episode_change_in_viewership)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Episode-to-episode",
       y = "Change in viewership of U.S. Viewers [%]",
       title = "Bar chart for change in episode-to-episode change in viewership.")
```

The biggest decrease of `r max_decrease` % has been seen between 3rd and 2nd episodes. On the other hand, the most remarkable peak in the viewership is associated with 7th and 6th components of the TV series. Considering the smallest relative difference it's equal to `r min_change`.
